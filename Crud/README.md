## About The Project

My motivation to create this application is driven by my desire to develop as a programmer. After this project I realized that there are no impossible things.
What is this project and what is it doing?

- Creating a table with a unique identifier
- If desired, a photo can be uploaded
- Flexible table, easy to use, fast orientation, simple and resposive design
- Single page application
- The first page is an information page
- The second page is the table
- Fast functioning
- Ability to delete or update data a row in the table

Not the perfect table but, of course, over time, the table will improve both the design and the way the table works. The next step is to work on the backend part.
